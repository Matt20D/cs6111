using google api, and pprint module:
1) https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-python-client/blob/main/samples/customsearch/main.py

Gravano's provided example for querying the google search engine. This was the main example used
in order to learn how to use google query api. I simply, used my same code
from project 1, but I figured I would pull in the source I used then
anyways.

using spacy and spanBERT examples:
2) http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~gravano/cs6111/Proj2/example_relations.py
3) http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~gravano/cs6111/Proj2/spacy_help_functions.py
used these sources in order to get an example of how to work with spacy and
with spanBert. I utilized a lot of the same commands (like we were advised
to do) in order to tokenize the sentences and then of course pass to bert.
The provided sample scripts were very good at explaining the steps we had to
do in order to scrape, process, and extract sentences and relation tuples.

web-scraping/beautiful soup:
4) https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45954949/parse-text-response-from-http-request-in-python
5) https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/

These references were useful for figuring out how to scrape data using the
BeautifulSoup package.
