# Advanced Databases

Skills learned: Information Retrieval and Extraction over web and unstructured text databases, and Data Mining from real-world datasets

In this course we moved beyond traditional RDBMs to learn how to source and process text databases efficiently. We also learned how to web scrape and exrtract information and data relations from text data. Lastly, using real world data that we wrangled we learn how to mine rule associations using support and confidence metrics with an Apriori Algorithm.
